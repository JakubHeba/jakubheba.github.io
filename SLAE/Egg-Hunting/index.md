# Egg Hunting #

Definition. Following the [fantastic document](http://www.hick.org/code/skape/papers/egghunt-shellcode.pdf) created by Skape:

*`Itâ€™s primarily useful for exploitation. Some exploit vectors only allow the attacker a very small amount of data to use when accomplishing their buffer overflow. For instance, the Internet Explorer object type vulnerability and the Subversion date parsing vulnerability are both examples of overflows that allow for a limited amount of data to be written and used as a payload at a deterministic location. However, both exploits allow for the attacker to place a large payload somewhere else in the address space of the process, though the location that it is stored at is indeterminate.  In the case of the object type vulnerability, an attacker can place their egg somewhere else in the HTML file, which in the end is translated into a heap allocated buffer that stores the contents of the page being processed.`*

In simple words, the Egg Hunting technique allows us to create a relatively short shellcode (~ 30/40), whose task is to search the memory (stack, heap, ...) in search of the original, long shellcode, which in normal conditions could not be used due to space restriction.

To this end, so-called tags are used, which is a string that will "point" to the beginning of the actual shellcode that immediately follows them.

Due to the speed of today's processors, the memory search process is rapid and almost imperceptible during exploitation.

In this article, I will try to describe the process of creating three different Egg Hunters listed in the Skapes document, namely:
- access #1
- access #2
- sigaction

### Access #1 ###

The simplest idea of egg hunting can be understood on a practical example. We'll start with the first method described by Skape using access() system call. It is used to verify whether a given process has permissions in the system to access the file on the filesystem.
As arguments, he takes only one value (the second in our case can be zero):
```sh
int (access const char * pathname, int mode);
```
It is also very important that the method does not perform any write operations, which could be very dangerous when searching the entire memory for the tag.

_start:

	mov ebx, 0x50905090		; Our TAG

	xor ecx, ecx			; ECX cleaning
	mul ecx				; EAX and EDX cleaning

loop:
	or dx, 0xfff			; 4096 bytes for iteration

iteration:
	inc edx				; EDX is incremented

	pusha				; Pushing all general purpose registers on the stack, to prevent eg. EAX value from changing during syscall
	lea ebx, [edx+0x4]		; Putting EDX + 4 bytes into the EBX, for preparing to the syscall (EBX is the first argument)

	mov al, 0x21			; syscall defining (#define __NR_access 33)
	int 0x80			; syscall execution, return value stored in EAX
	
	cmp al, 0xf2			; comparing the return value with 0xf2, which means, that if syscall returns an EFAULT error, Zero Flag is set
	
	popa				; popping all general purpose registers from the stack
	
	jz loop				; If comparing returns True (EFAULT error, ZF set), next 4096 bytes of memory, and next iteration

	; Here, we are looking for the TAG in this part of memory	
	cmp [edx], ebx			; Check, that EDX points to our TAG value, and set ZF, if true
	
	jnz iteration			; If ZF is not set, JMP to the INC instruction and repeat the process
	
	cmp [edx+0x4], ebx		; Check, that we have our second TAG value, to prevent from mistakes
						
	jnz iteration			; If ZF is not set, JMP to the INC instruction and repeat the process, otherwise, eggs are found
	
	jmp edx				; JMP directly to the right Shellcode
```
After saving, we compile, link, and put the resulting shellcode into a wrapper written in the C language.
```sh

main()
{

	printf("Egghunter Length: %d\n", strlen(egghunter));
	printf("Shellcode Length:  %d\n", strlen(code));

	int (*ret)() = (int(*)())egghunter;

	ret();

### Access #2 ###

Another example is also based on access() system call, but its implementation is slightly more optimal, which means we are able to save 4 bytes in length.

### Sigaction ###

The last technique will be to use sigaction() call system. This method is the most optimal (about 3 times faster) and 5 bytes shorter (30 bytes in length).

It gains a clear acceleration by being able to process more than one address at a time (which was a restriction for the first two methods).

Following the Skape document:

*`The sigaction approach allows multiple addresses tobe validated at a single time by taking advantage of the kernelâ€™s verify area routine which is used, for instance, on structures that have been passed in from user-mode to a system call.
[..]
The goal here will be to use the act structure as the pointer for validating alarger region of memory than a single byte (as was the case with the access system call)`*

Finding the system call identifier:
```sh
$ cat /usr/include/i386-linux-gnu/asm/unistd_32.h | grep sigaction
#define __NR_sigaction 67
```
Verification of required arguments:
```sh
$ man 2 sigaction | grep "int sigaction"
int sigaction(int signum, const struct sigaction *act,
                     struct sigaction *oldact);
```
